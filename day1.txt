2.  Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that is, currently, the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

These are the high-level differences between HTTP1 and HTTP2:
•	HTTP2 is binary, instead of textual
•	HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
•	HTTP2 can, therefore, use one connection for parallelism
•	HTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead
•	HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches

3. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are complex and each object may contain a combination of primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Suzuki';
myCar.model = 'Altros';
myCar.year = 1978;
myCar.wheels = 2;
After creating myCar object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.
i.e. myCar.year
Output: 1978
These values can be accessed using brackets notation also.
